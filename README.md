# Early Warning System

## Objectives

This project aims to develop an Early Warning System (EWS) for financial markets, utilizing anomaly detection techniques to identify potential market crises before they escalate. By leveraging data science methodologies, the EWS seeks to improve risk management and enhance overall financial performance. The focus is on recognizing abnormal market conditions and signaling risk without relying solely on predictive models. Instead, it emphasizes *nowcasting*, allowing for timely interventions.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Implementing algorithms to identify deviations from normal market behavior.
- **Risk Management Tools**: Providing insights to detect and respond to potential crises.
- **Data Sources**: Utilizing a variety of financial data from reputable sources to train our models.
